title: "Weekend Project - Not Codenames"

My last weekend project was back May 2020 where a friend and I built [Not Codenames](https://notcodenames.com) - a clone of the popular board game. This project helped me make sense of React Hooks - I immediately loved it and it makes sense why Vue 3 is introducing the Composition API. We had lots of pair programming going on in a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/code-names-project-vyvcr) environment, it was an awesome experience - much better than VSCode Live Share or older solutions like Cloud9 and Koding. Read more about the development on [Kien's blog post](https://kiendang.me/088-notcodenames/). I also challenge you to find a better clone that has a better UX - we designed our realtime app to be simple to understand as a new player because each player is given a role and instructions for the duration of a game. You'll notice that other alternatives fall short in that aspect because they are all designed to simulate a table top experience.
