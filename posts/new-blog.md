title: "Be clear & concise"

I started this blog for a few reasons:

1.  **To organize my thoughts** I think a lot. I unintentially like to multi-task and that's detrimental to being able to think coherently. Overtime I feel like my thoughts and knowledge of things feel fragmented. I'm hoping that topics I write down will help me form the building blocks needed to improve my ability to think and explain things in a clear and concise manner.

2.  **Control over my content** Zanga, Yahoo Mail, and Flickr were services that either sunset or changed their policies which made me lose my data. I have a good feeling that this JAMStack blog will stick around because I have full ownership of my content. I highly recommend you look into [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) over other blog alternatives if you're looking for a solution that doesn't feel like a black box and want simplicity in development.

3.  **Document life events** It's an interest time to start a new blog. I quit my full-time job late 2019 to take time off to work on my passion project and also _attempt_ to start a family (more on this one day).
