Today marks one year since I left my job at Microsoft to build Scrim full-time! As of 2 months ago, I'm also a full-time father!

This past month I worked on new features for Scrim tournaments:

#### Feature #1

Frag highlights feature will include: no scopes, knife, taser, in-the-air and any combination of smoke, penetration and blind kills. A recent match played by [LinkedIn vs Microsoft](https://www.scrim.app/tournaments/m5RbYkHGavSZjqBQv5wm/s/PhTRYY6BwqE7dwwKA1vO/1) showcases some of these new types of highlights.

#### Feature #2

I added a new lobby feature to the Scrim platform. It's a browser-based ping function which shows everyone's latency to each server location. This helps teams decide which server location to choose for a fair game.
