The COVID-19 pandemic created an influx of players. I implemented a subscription-based pricing model with Stripe but I never ended up using it because **I ended up pivoting the business model**. Popflash, a competitor, also implemented a subscription-based model because their Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) reached [$8,000/month in server fees](https://popflash.site/blog/coronavirus-update) which was unsustainable.

I wanted to build an Esports company. Instead of serving individual players, I started exploring how to cater to tournament organizers. **The idea was to automate the management of tournaments and have tournaments organizers bring in the players. As a company of one, this approach would allow me to focus on building instead of marketing.**

A few notable moments when pivoting:

1. Since I had competed in corporate leagues since 2015 and knew exactly the pain points for small-medium tournament organizers. I pitched my services to [CEA.gg](https://cea.gg) and they bought in for their 2020 Spring season which started ran from March to June. I iterated on [Scrim Tournaments](https://www.scrim.app/tournaments) throughout their season and listened to feedback. **It's surprising to find how the most valuable feedback and reporting of issues is not always direct. I had to watch player streams and look at chat logs to discover them myself.** <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First up, after a hard-fought and wildly entertaining <a href="https://twitter.com/CSGO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CSGO</a> season, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Microsoft?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Microsoft</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Office?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Office</a> ultimately took the throne!

2. Earlier this year, my team had competed in two tournaments, one of them which we [won](https://www.faceit.com/en/championship/0d71b8be-07b3-4a13-9b76-0137b3dd09dd/Mapcore%20Wingman%20Season%203%20Playoffs%20NA/standings/column). We saw first-hand the troubles and inefficiencies of Faceit's tournament services. A few teams dropped out of the tournament because of the long delays between matches. It appears that the organizers didn't have any other options but to continue using Faceit. **I pitched my services but they needed support for their EU players and I did not have plans for expansion into the EU then. I now see this as a missed opportunity.** <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congratulations to our Wingman Tournament winners - Team BrettGmbH (Karuso33, STRNK1_1) for EU and Team Dduk Guk (csxr, irok) for NA!!

3. It took a few weeks of iteration for the service to be "self managed". I define that term as not needing any manual intervention on my part for the service to run smoothly. **By April, I started going out on weekends without worrying about things blowing up.**

4. I generated $160 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) within the first week of pivoting. My operating expense ratio (OER) at that time was about 25%. I knew that if I could onboard more tournament organizers and have a shared pool of servers, the expense ratio would significantly drop. **This was validation that my pivot was in the right direction.**

The tech stack which I briefly covered in [part 1](/posts/scrim-part1) helped me build with confidence. I designed [scrim.app](https://www.scrim.app) with the goal of being easy to maintain for myself, low cost, and highly available & consistent. Thanks to serverless functions, the Firebase platform, and many open source projects - I am able to achieve just that in a short period of time.
